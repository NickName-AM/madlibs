Children are fascinated by <<ADJECTIVE>> stuff-like stories that scare the <<PLURAL_NOUN>> off them or make their <<PLURAL_NOUN>> stand on end. Scientists say this is because being frightened causes the <<SILLY_WORD>> gland to function and puts <<TYPE_OF_LIQUID>> into their blood. And everyone knows that makes kids feel <<ADJECTIVE>>. When they are scared by a movie or a/an <<NOUN>>, boys laugh and holler and <<VERB>>. But girls cover their eyes with their <<PLURAL_NOUN>> and keep screaming and <<Verb4(ing)>>. Most kids get over this by the time they are <<NUMBER>> years old. Then they like movies about cars <<VERB4(ing)>> or cops shooting <<PLURAL_NOUN>>, or, if they are girls, they like movies about a boy meeting a/an <<NOUN>> and falling in love. Of course, that can be scary, too.
